# URL Inspector

Small set of tools to inspect an URL (a GUI for `new URL(...)`), decode/encode base64 (a GUI for `atob(...)` & `btoa(...)`) and a JWT decoder.

Built with [solid](https://github.com/ryansolid/solid) and vite

## Usage

```bash
$ pnpm install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000] to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `pnpm build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)
